# Cloud Security Posture Assessment Research Project

This project is developed as part of a research initiative for a Cyber Security program at the University of Derby. The aim of this research is to address the risks associated with cloud security misconfigurations by developing a Python-based, command-line interface (CLI) tool. This tool is specifically designed to help organizations, particularly those with limited resources, assess and improve their cloud security posture.

# Project Background
Cloud computing has become vital for various organizations, including enterprises and non-profits (NPOs), due to its scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. However, it also introduces significant security risks, particularly through misconfigurations, which can leave cloud resources vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches.

Given the financial constraints and limited access to advanced security tools faced by smaller organizations and NPOs, this project is dedicated to creating a cost-effective, open-source tool. This tool will enable these organizations to detect, mitigate, and prevent misconfigurations in their cloud environments, particularly within AWS, and to strengthen their overall cloud security posture. Future contributions will aim to expand the toolâ€™s capabilities to support additional cloud platforms.
